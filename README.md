Machine learning handcrafted Features extraction and Classification
<h1>Problem</h1>
There r three classes (Car, Cone, ball) which are far away from each other.
Train the different classifier to classify images based on given scenarios.

1) train logistic  on full images.

2) use SIFT extractor and train.
   
3) use ORB extractor and train.
   
4) use HOG extractor and train.

5) prepare a written report containing from abstract to conclusion chapters.
   
   there should be clear reasons to select one of the classifier.
   there should be brief discussion on mentioned extractors and classify them as well.
   mention the best extractor based on authentic reasons and draw backs of the rests.
