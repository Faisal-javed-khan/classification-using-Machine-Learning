<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This project aims to develop an image classification system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify images into three categories: Car, Cone, and Ball. The objectives are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore feature extraction techniques (SIFT, ORB, HOG)</li>
<li>Train machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM)</li>
<li>Evaluate model performance</li>
</ul>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision. It involves assigning a label to an image based on its content. Machine learning techniques have shown great promise in image classification tasks.</p>
<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>The problem is to develop an image classification system that can accurately classify images into three categories: Car, Cone, and Ball.</p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>We collected a dataset of images and extracted features using SIFT, ORB, and HOG. We then trained four machine learning models and evaluated their performance using accuracy metrics.</p>
<h3>Data Collection</h3>
<p>We collected a dataset of 1000 images, with 500 images per class.</p>
<h3>Feature Extraction</h3>
<p>We extracted features from the images using SIFT, ORB, and HOG.</p>
<h3>Model Training</h3>
<p>We trained four machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest</p>

<h3>Model Evaluation</h3>
<p>We evaluated the performance of each model using accuracy metrics.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>The results show that HOG features with Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy of 90%.</p>
<h3>Accuracy Comparison</h3>
<p>The accuracy of each model is shown in the table below:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Model</th>
<th>Accuracy</th>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>The results indicate that HOG features are effective in image classification. Logistic Regression outperformed other models, likely due to its simplicity and ability to handle high-dimensional data.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This project demonstrated the effectiveness of HOG features and Logistic Regression in image classification. Future work should explore other feature extractors and deep learning models.</p>
<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Explore other feature extractors (e.g., CNN-based features)</li>
<li>Investigate deep learning models (e.g., CNN, ResNet)</li>
<li>Evaluate performance on a larger dataset</li>
</ul>
